## Abstract

This article proposes a dialogue between the video game *Disco Elysium* and the heterogeneous philosophy of the French thinker Georges Bataille. Far from adhering to a unified or predefined identity, the protagonist, Harry Du Bois, is configured as a figure in constant transformation, whose identity emerges from an unstable interplay between chance and decision. Through dice rolls—a key mechanic in role-playing video games—*Disco Elysium* destabilizes the classical boundaries of the self, giving rise to a fragmented subject affected by contradictory voices and impulses. The article traces an intersection between philosophy and game studies, arguing that *Disco Elysium* articulates contemporary configurations of subjectivity in terms of openness and contingency.

**Keywords:** inner experience; chance; heterogeneity; subjectivity; game mechanics.

## Introduction

The team responsible for developing the video game *Disco Elysium* received four statuettes at the sixth edition of *The Game Awards*[^1]. During the acceptance speech, the game’s screenwriter, Helen Hindpere, thanked several figures who had inspired the development team, including the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky and the singer Viktor Tsoi (Jackson, 2019). Two names, however, resonated with particular force in the auditorium: Hindpere also expressed her gratitude to Marx and Engels for their political education (Jackson, 2019). Video games are increasingly explicit about their philosophical and political influences, gradually abandoning the sphere of neutral entertainment devoid of articulated discourse[^2].

This article proposes an interpretation of *Disco Elysium* through the philosophy of Georges Bataille, approaching the game not merely as a cultural artifact with ideological significance, but as a medium capable of staging radical philosophical experiences. The central hypothesis of this research is that a close relationship exists between the dice roll as a core mechanic in the Estonian title and Bataille’s notion of inner experience, insofar as both operate as dispositifs that suspend fixed meaning and linear narrativity. In *Disco Elysium*, chance dramatizes the passage from a closed subject to an open and heterogeneous form of subjectivity. Although philosophers such as Henri Bergson and Gilles Deleuze have also theorized chance, Bataille’s thought is particularly apt for capturing the fragmentation and extremity that permeate the game—through figures such as putting oneself at stake, extreme experience, and the absence of a project. Bataille thus provides a set of conceptual tools especially suited to addressing chance and openness within the history of philosophy.

Far from merely representing a narrative world, *Disco Elysium** functions as an aesthetic machine that activates a form of subjectivity in crisis, resonating with Bataille’s notion of inner experience. The game does not simply articulate a political position; rather, it traverses politics through a logic of dissolution, excess, and loss that challenges the dominant frameworks of modern rationality.

Released in 2019 by ZA/UM, *Disco Elysium* is a role-playing video game set in the fictional city of Revachol, a post-revolutionary space evoking both the remnants of Eastern Europe and the ruins of the global communist imaginary. The player assumes the role of a detective who, after a night of extreme intoxication, awakens in a hotel room with no memory of his identity, his mission, or his past. This episode of amnesia is not merely a narrative device; it constitutes the very condition of possibility for the emergence of a fractured and volatile identity radically open to contingency. The protagonist—later revealed to be Harry Du Bois—is compelled to reconstruct himself not only biographically, but also ideologically, emotionally, and philosophically, while confronting a city that operates as a living archive of historical trauma, social conflict, and contradictory impulses. This radical exposure to the world, in which the self dissolves and recomposes itself through chance, excess, and extreme situations, closely resonates with Bataille’s concept of inner experience.

The game’s structure is organized around twenty-four skills divided into four categories: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics. These skills do not merely determine gameplay abilities; they manifest as internal voices that engage in dialogue with one another and with the player. Skills such as Drama, Empathy, Rhetoric, Volition, Authority, or Electrochemistry articulate competing perspectives that seek to influence decisions, transforming identity into an assembly perpetually marked by tension. This mechanism is reinforced by the Thought Cabinet, which allows players to internalize ideas—such as communism, advanced race theory, or hardcore aesthetics—thereby altering statistics, dialogue options, and the character’s overall relation to the world. Unlike other computer role-playing games, *Disco Elysium* does not reward linear progression or the accumulation of power; failure, contradiction, and indecision are not obstacles to progress but ordinary conditions of play[^3].

The central investigation—a murder by lynching in the context of a labor strike—provides a narrative thread, yet the game’s core lies in the way the player negotiates their place within a fractured world. Rather than guiding the player toward a coherent resolution, *Disco Elysium* invites a drift along the margins of meaning, embracing ambiguity, failure, and irreconcilability. The ludic experience thus becomes a form of exposure to the impossible, in which identity itself is continually put at stake. As Bataille writes, “communication, however weak, wants to be put into play. It has no place except insofar as beings, inclined outside themselves, risk the game, under threat of degradation” (1972: 54). *Disco Elysium* offers no certainties, only a continual risk to the subject, whose voice falters with every attempt to make sense of a world no longer governed by familiar patterns.

Rather than serving as a mere case study or a superficial illustration of a theoretical corpus, *Disco Elysium* demands to be read alongside Georges Bataille because both operate through the same fundamental gesture: the destabilization of the modern subject through a playful experience of excess and fragmentation. The player does not inhabit a rational subject who progresses through the accumulation of knowledge, but a defeated, intoxicated body exposed to contradictory forces it cannot synthesize or master. The game’s internal dialogic structure does not simply represent psychological plurality; it stages a scene of extreme communication in which the subject continually risks its own dissolution. This exposure, this decentering, is not incidental to the narrative but constitutes the game’s central mechanism.

In this sense, Bataille’s philosophy offers a conceptual framework for approaching video games at their deepest level—not merely as narrative or cultural objects, but as liminal experiences, as fields of intensity in which the categories of utility, communicability, and stability are suspended. The reliance on chance through dice rolls, the dismantling of the self via the Thought Cabinet, and the general economy of the game—which resists the cumulative logic typical of the genre—all point toward a logic of unproductive expenditure that finds its most compelling philosophical counterpart in Bataille’s work. The aim of this article, then, is not to impose a theoretical lens upon a playful object, but to make explicit the Bataillean operation that *Disco Elysium* already performs, revealing a shared constellation of problems traversing contemporary philosophy and art.

## A Roll of the Dice

During the course of the investigation, the player may encounter Neha, a dice maker who sells handmade dice for role-playing games. The meta-narrative dimension of this discreet side quest is not the only element relevant to this article; several of the conversations with Neha provide conceptual material that resonates directly with Georges Bataille’s theoretical framework. The encounter begins when the protagonist asks about the other businesses that once gave life to the small commercial area where she now works:

> **YOU** — “You’re right, they should have tried harder. They had everything they needed to succeed.”
> **DICE MAKER** — “Even so, not everyone can do it.” She tosses a pair of dice onto the table; one of them stops close to the metal edge. “That’s how the game goes.”
> **PERCEPTION (SIGHT)** — The result is 1. On a 20-sided die. (ZA/UM, 2019)

Throughout *Disco Elysium*, dice rolls function as a fundamental narrative and ludic device. Althought the player's reactions to this brief exchange may vary depending on which skill is activated at the time —since higher skill levels increase the frequency and intesity of ther inventions—all possible response articulate a shared stance: the fatalism inherent in rolling the dice. This violence of chance, of putting oneself at stake constitutes one of the central motifs of Georges Bataille’s philosophical thought. As he writes, “The leap is life, the reckoning is death. And if history stops, I die” (Bataille, 1972: 106).

Philosophy, in many of its traditions, has tended to marginalize the risk intrinsic to living. Theoretical activity has often unfolded in a self-referential mode, producing concepts from other concepts within closed systems governed by internal coherence and resistant to external disruption. Such withdrawal has rendered philosophy poorly equipped to account for contingency, excess, and lived intensity. Bataille, by contrast, seeks to recover a Nietzschean impulse—rooted in the will to power—by foregrounding a subject who puts themselves on the line, who opens themselves to the world in order to be affected by it, thereby restoring a lost connection to a sacred and continuous realm, foreign to the segmented logic of productive labor. Danger thus becomes inseparable from knowledge itself: a moment of genuine intensity that “can endanger the lives of those who participate in it” (Berlantini, 2020: 198).

In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche already describes this playful and tragic attitude—open yet exposed—that philosophy has largely neglected:

> But the true philosopher […] lives in a “non-philosophical” and “non-wise” manner, above all in a non-intelligent manner, and feels the weight and duty of a hundred attempts and temptations in life: he constantly risks himself, plays the bad game. (Nietzsche, 1997: §205)

The vitality implied by this constant risk gives rise to a multiplicity of meanings and interpretations capable of generating entirely new worlds. The radically heterogeneous character of the will to power short-circuits any attempt to stabilize meaning within traditional philosophical frameworks. On the side of heterogeneous existence, there is circulation and continuity of impulses (Berlantini, 2020: 199); on the side of hermetic thinking, which interrupts communication with the outside, thought merely reproduces the same ontology in an almost obsessive repetition. Dice, by contrast, expose thought to danger: chance enables the production of meaning rather than the mere representation of worlds.

A later dialogue with Neha makes this logic explicit:

> **YOU** — “I’m sorry. I don’t know how to answer that. It’s entropy.”
> **DICE MAKER** — “Yes.” She looks out the window, barely listening. “Or maybe everyone’s cursed? It’s such a precarious place. Nothing ever turns out the way you want it to.”
> **DICE MAKER** — “That’s why people like role-playing games. You can be whoever you want. You can try again. Even so, there’s something inherently violent in rolling dice.”
> **DICE MAKER** — “It’s as if every time you roll a die, something disappears. Some alternate ending. Or a completely different world…” She lifts the dice and inspects them under the light. (ZA/UM, 2019)

Role-playing must be understood from both sides of this operation. When a character is played, one virtual outcome is actualized and unfolds within the narrative. At the same time, rolling the dice irrevocably abolishes other possible worlds, abandoning unrealized paths and foreclosing alternative experiences. There is an irreducible violence in this gesture. As Bataille writes, “to live is to throw the dice wildly, but with no return” (2018: 200).

At first glance, *Disco Elysium* appears to contradict this principle. The game allows players to save their progress before attempting a dice roll, making it possible to reload and retry if the outcome is unsatisfactory. Does this not neutralize the violence of chance? Does it not introduce a return that Bataille explicitly denies? To address this tension, it is necessary to recall that, for Bataille, chance is inseparable from necessity. Chance is not opposed to necessity; it is its contingent form. Gambling does not consist in being lucky, but in exposing oneself to luck—whereas refusing to gamble amounts to losing luck altogether (Christias, 2018: 66). The roll of the dice is thus a mode of being in the world, a way of entering into communion with its continuous and unstable flow.

To eliminate the consequences of a dice roll entirely would be to eliminate chance itself—to suppress the historical and temporal character of the world, and with it the emergence of novelty and alterity (Christias, 2018: 66). Hayley Toth addresses this apparent paradox in her article “Bad Reading/Bad Gaming,” referring to a late-game conversation between Harry and his partner Kim Kitsuragi. After a series of hostile interactions, Kim threatens to abandon the investigation. When he ultimately decides to stay, Harry asks whether this means he is being given a second chance. Kim responds bluntly:

> **KIM** — No, you damn fool. This isn’t a *game*, and you’re not the *hero*. You don’t have *infinite* chances to do the right thing. The world doesn’t work that way. (ZA/UM, 2019)

Here, *Disco Elysium* stages a meta-referential reflection on its own mechanics. Although reloading is technically possible, it does not annul the consequences experienced within a given save, nor does it erase the player’s encounter with those consequences. There is no absolute return, no true abolition of chance. Once the subject has been put into play, the world has already acted upon them. As Toth notes, the game deliberately blurs the distinction between Harry’s actions and the player’s actions: the second-person address is “doubly deictic,” referring simultaneously to the protagonist and to the player performing the role (Toth, 2024: 4).

Reloading the game does not exonerate the player; on the contrary, it reinforces Kim’s accusation. Attempting to negate chance becomes itself a form of bad play. Even if the player chooses not to continue along a particular narrative branch, the experience of that branch persists in memory. In this sense, the player has still made the mistake, still inhabited a world in which they were reprimanded for assuming that actions would carry no consequences (Toth, 2024: 4).

The ludic praxis proposed by *Disco Elysium* thus consists not in controlling outcomes, but in liberating action through exposure to chance—what Christias describes as the desire for luck (2018: 62). From a Bataillean perspective, necessity and chance are indistinguishable, since neither is subordinated to human will or rational mastery. Rewriting the game cannot interrupt the chaotic unfolding of the world; it can only simulate such an interruption. What remains available to the player is the decision to enter into play, to risk themselves in order to experience the world and to communicate with the forces that shape them.

This Bataillean gesture of putting oneself at stake inherits Nietzsche’s transvaluation of all values, which demands that we “seek new values” and recognize that “we have never yet given our human existence a moderate value” (Nietzsche, 2000: 51). Chance thus becomes a challenge to the status quo: a transgressive movement enacted by a subject who opens themselves to new forms of existence. Between emptiness and excess, chance reopens the game of the world and exposes the subject to its play (Christias, 2018: 64).

If luck grants us a chance—not as something received from outside, but as the very way we exist, playing and striving until the end—then nothing can be said in advance about what will be possible. It will not be possible; it will be played. And play, ultimately, implies the impossible:

> And luck, the game, ultimately implies the impossible. (Bataille, 1972: 137)

## The character in crisis

The dice rolls that structure both Bataille’s philosophy and *Disco Elysium* have direct consequences for the concept of identity. The role-playing system of the Estonian game prevents the construction of a closed or definitive protagonist, instead problematizing the ways in which the character recognizes, names, presents, and continuously reconfigures himself in relation to the world and to himself.

In the opening moments of the game, the player is invited to explore the room in which the protagonist regains consciousness after his episode of amnesia. Upon entering the bathroom, he encounters a mirror obscured by thick steam. The game offers the possibility of wiping the glass to reveal the character’s reflection, but this option is immediately challenged by one of the internal voices, INLAND EMPIRE, which intervenes to dissuade the player:

> **INLAND EMPIRE** — Stop! It’s clear that you haven’t thought this through. You’re not going to like what you’re about to see. And you’ll never be able to stop being it. (ZA/UM, 2019)

This brief scene introduces one of the game’s central mechanics: identity is neither transparent nor stable, but constantly mediated by internal forces that undermine any claim to unity. The discovery of one’s own face—of a visual and narrative identity—is suspended, leaving the player to choose between confronting the unknown or continuing without access to a fixed image of the self. Identity thus appears not as a given, but as a risk.

The protagonist’s ideals and statements are not presented as simple characterization devices, nor as the univocal authorial voice of the development team. Instead, every utterance is inscribed within a complex system of abilities that function as tools for navigating the world. In *Disco Elysium*, it is therefore common for fragmented and competing voices to articulate the subjectivity of the playable character, producing a polyphonic structure in which no single perspective can claim authority (Vela, 2021: 99).

The game’s mechanics imply a fundamentally ludic approach to identity or, in Bataille’s terms, a self perpetually exposed to challenge. Identity in *Disco Elysium* operates as movement rather than substance, as an endless poietic impulse that transgresses all fixed limits:

> I now discern in the game that movement which, by not relating the present to the future of a given being, refers it to a being that is not yet: the game, in that sense, does not place action at the service of the agent or of any already existing being, in that it exceeds the limits of being. (Bataille, 1972: 185)

Within this polyphonic dialogue, it is impossible to identify which of the twenty-four voices constitutes the protagonist’s “true” voice—whether any of them can be associated with the name Harrier “Harry” Du Bois, or with one of his alter egos, such as Tequila Sunset. The protagonist is continually projected toward someone he is not yet. The dialogism of *Disco Elysium* follows a logic of accumulation—an “and, and, and”—rather than one of exclusion or opposition[^4] , thereby preventing the emergence of a closed and hermetic subject.

Although the player may attempt to privilege certain skills over others, exercising a form of despotic control by selectively listening to particular voices, every decisive moment ultimately requires a roll of the dice. While dialogue options may lean toward empathy, aggression, or irony depending on the activated skill, chance ultimately prevails over any coherent strategy. This rebellious element, which acts against the player’s own agency, is precisely what allows *Disco Elysium* to construct a heterogeneous and chaotic space. No stable plan can be devised; luck can derail even the most carefully staged detective performance at any moment, forcing the player to adapt and, at times, to risk everything on a second roll.

Harry is not defined solely by what he says, nor by his interactions with objects or with the voices in his head. Rather, he is immersed in a continuous process of becoming, exposed to a universal randomness that destabilizes any attempt at fixing identity (McKeown, 2021: 74). With each roll of the dice, the conditions under which a stable subject might be articulated shift dramatically. Minor decisions can reshape the entire ludic structure, including the sense of continuity the player maintains with the character they inhabit.

Across a narrative that can extend for more than sixty hours, Harry Du Bois cannot be understood as a fixed or coherent identity. Far from corresponding to a classical, unified subject, he emerges as a dynamic construction, constantly displaced by both player choice and mechanical randomness. Yet subjectivity does not vanish; it persists as the organizing axis of the experience. What changes is the mode of embodiment: identity becomes permeable, transitory, and perpetually in process. As McKeown observes, *Disco Elysium* does not offer a predefined project, but an incessant practice of self-recomposition, traversed by multiple forces that produce, again and again, a different Harry (2021: 75).

It is precisely this notion of the project that is subjected to critique throughout Georges Bataille’s work. To articulate a project or strategy implies a form of discursive thought that orders heterogeneity. “Discursive thinking,” writes Bataille, “is the work of a being engaged in action; it takes place within that being on the basis of their projects” (1986: 54). Such a position reduces the subject to a spectator who reflects upon action rather than exposing themselves to experience. In the context of video games, this logic often persists despite the appearance of interactivity: the player follows a predefined trajectory, pursuing goals and optimizing outcomes.

*Disco Elysium*, by contrast, operates as a paradigmatic example of a game without a project—or, more precisely, a game that continually dissolves the project it appears to propose. Although the narrative is structured around a detective investigation, this overarching goal is repeatedly destabilized by multiple endings, divergent character configurations, and unpredictable moments of chance. No ending is privileged; no strategy guarantees success. In the early stages of the game, the protagonist may even die while attempting to retrieve a necktie from a ceiling fan, forcing the player to restart the game if they wish to continue. These disruptions allow the player to abandon the logic of the project and to follow a path shaped by contingency rather than calculation.

Bataille formulates this escape from the project with particular clarity:

> And ecstasy is the solution! Harmony! Perhaps—but heartbreaking. The way out? It is enough for me to look for it: I fall again, inert, pitiful. A solution outside the project, outside the will to find a solution! For the project is the prison from which I want to escape. (Bataille, 1986: 67)

Whether he appears as Detective Harrier Du Bois, the enigmatic Tequila Sunset, or an unnamed alcoholic, the protagonist of *Disco Elysium* cannot be reduced to a project or to the logic of instrumental action. The inner experiences staged by the game—through chaotic dialogues and arbitrary dice rolls—continually throw subjectivity into a Nietzschean process of becoming. Bataille’s vital attitude allows us to grasp this open wound at the heart of the narrative: a subject sustained by what is “irreducible to the project”—non-discursive existence, laughter, and ecstasy—ultimately leading to “a total disappearance of what man is, of all human affirmation” (Bataille, 1986: 89).

## Putting communication into play

Rolling the dice presupposes an open self, and an open self inevitably seeks to communicate with the world. Read through Bataille’s philosophy, *Disco Elysium* problematizes not only the player’s relationship with the protagonist, but also the very conditions under which communication takes place—between characters, with the city of Revachol, and even with inanimate objects.

One particularly revealing scene occurs when the protagonist goes to sleep after his first day of police work. Depending on the player’s previous choices, the character may encounter a disturbing dream in which he recognizes his own face in the corpse discovered behind the Whirling-in-Rags hostel. The dialogue unfolds as follows:

> **SWOLLEN CORPSE OF A DRUNK** — Do you remember this smell from your childhood?
> **YOU** — I don’t remember anything.
> **SWOLLEN CORPSE OF A DRUNK** — Do you remember your wife’s hand on your face?
> **YOU** — Tell me what’s going on! I won’t answer until you tell me who you are.
> **SWOLLEN CORPSE OF A DRUNK** — You know who I am. I am that bad day. That day when you asked her, and then wandered the streets… It’s the worst day ever, my dear Harry, and here it comes. She’ll hear it on the phone. Reality will become a grotesque nightmare. That was the last thing you did to her. Tell me: do you remember the love of your life?
> **YOU** — She left me. (ZA/UM, 2019)

This exchange exemplifies a form of communication that cannot be reduced to the transmission of information. The interlocutor is neither fully other nor fully identical to the protagonist; it occupies a liminal position, emerging from within while confronting the self as something radically alien. Communication here is inseparable from exposure. The subject does not master meaning but is instead affected by it, wounded by it.

For Bataille, communication is never guaranteed. It does not occur between stable, self-contained subjects, but only insofar as beings are inclined outside themselves and risk dissolution. As he writes, communication “has no place except insofar as beings, inclined outside themselves, put themselves into play” (1972: 54). In *Disco Elysium*, communication consistently takes this risky form: to speak is to expose oneself, to open a breach through which the world can intrude.

This logic extends beyond dialogues with human characters. Revachol itself communicates through fragments, ruins, and hallucinated voices. Objects speak; memories intrude; skills interrupt. The city addresses the protagonist not as a coherent subject but as a fractured assemblage, continually destabilizing the boundaries between inner and outer, self and world. Communication thus becomes an event rather than an exchange, a moment in which identity trembles.

Crucially, this exposure is not framed as a failure of communication but as its condition of possibility. Against instrumental models of dialogue—where communication serves understanding, consensus, or utility—*Disco Elysium* stages what might be called a Bataillean communication without guarantees. Meaning is neither stabilized nor secured; it emerges precariously through chance encounters, failed utterances, and traumatic repetitions.

The use of second-person address intensifies this effect. The “you” of *Disco Elysium* is doubly oriented: it refers simultaneously to Harry Du Bois and to the player inhabiting his role. This ambiguity collapses the distance between subject and spectator, implicating the player in the communicative risk staged by the game. To be addressed is already to be involved, already to be exposed.
Communication, then, is not a neutral channel within *Disco Elysium*, but a site of play and danger. Words do not simply describe the world; they reopen it, putting the subject at stake once more. In this sense, the game enacts what Bataille identifies as the most radical form of communication: one that does not preserve the subject, but threatens it, undoing its boundaries in the name of experience.

## Conclusions

The reflections developed throughout this article allow us to understand *Disco Elysium* as an aesthetic and philosophical artifact in which the subject—dislocated by chance, the multiplicity of voices, and the failure of meaning—remains in play through its openness to uncertainty. Within this framework, the figure of *amor fati* functions as a synthesis of the central elements analyzed: surrender to fate, the impossibility of closure, unresolved desire, and the affirmation of contingency. The image of Dolores Dei—a historical figure from the city of Revachol—as well as the persistent memory of Dora, Harry’s ex-wife, condense, in their affective and visionary dimension, the tension between discontinuity and the longing for communication that runs through Georges Bataille’s philosophy of play and experience. This link serves here as a concluding figure for the themes discussed.

The Estonian title invites us to read *Disco Elysium* as a playful reformulation of Nietzschean *amor fati*: “My formula for expressing greatness in man is *amor fati* [love of fate]: not wanting anything to be different, either in the past or in the future or for all eternity” (Nietzsche, 2005: 73, brackets in the original). Throughout the video game, the mechanics analyzed—the dice rolls, destabilized subjectivity, and the search for intimate communication—form a framework that affirms the acceptance of chance as destiny and conceives play as a field in which heterogeneity manifests itself. As Bataille writes, “luck, gambling, ultimately imply the impossible” (1972: 137).

From this perspective, the protagonist of *Disco Elysium* does not merely suffer from amnesia or psychological fragmentation, but from an open wound that never fully heals. This existential hiatus is clearly expressed in the figure of Dora, whose memory persistently intrudes throughout the game as an image operating beyond the rational plane. Even amid polyphonic voices and radical forgetfulness, Harry remains unable to forget the woman who left him years ago. The desire for reunion, the interrupted conversation, shapes a longing for continuity that runs through the entire narrative.

This desire reaches one of its most intense expressions in the dreamlike episode in which the figures of Dora and Dolores Dei merge. If, during an earlier mission, the player has interacted with a stained-glass window depicting Dolores Dei in an abandoned church, the possibility of a subsequent dream in which both figures converge becomes available. In that initial encounter, Kim attempts to draw the protagonist out of his absorption:

> **KIM KITSURAGI** — Agent, you’ve been standing there for over five minutes…
> **KIM KITSURAGI** — What are you thinking about, if I may ask?
> **YOU** — She’s beautiful… (ZA/UM, 2019)

Throughout *Disco Elysium*, numerous images communicate with the protagonist in an intense and unsettling manner, forcing an inner experience that exceeds ordinary discourse. As Noys observes in his reading of Bataille, “it was never a matter of personal contemplation, but of sharing with others through the image—the image as an opening to the Other” (Noys, 2000: 35). Here, the image does not refer to a closed interiority, but instead becomes a site of openness toward alterity, toward a form of meaning that is non-discursive yet profoundly affective. Harry is thus thrown into a mode of communication beyond language with Dora, and the scene in the church constitutes only one among many such moments.

*Disco Elysium* projects a longing for community, broken communication, and lost continuity: “We are discontinuous beings, individuals who die in isolation in an unintelligible adventure; but we retain a nostalgia for lost continuity” (Bataille, 2023: 11). It is this longing that drives Harry to continue exploring, to roll the dice once more. This open wound—this absence of reconciliation—allows him to reconnect with his past and to confront the world anew, since carnal love, which is never “safe from thieves” and which “puts at stake” both lover and beloved, stands in opposition to a God who, “by definition, is not at stake” (Bataille, 1972: 55).

As Bataille insists, it is precisely difference—an abyss—that allows subjectivity to be continually reformulated. Without this difference, “identity remains at stake,” and “the response given to desire is never certain unless it is apprehended”; yet “an apprehensible response is the destruction of desire.” These limits, he writes, “define us”: we exist insofar as we play, and “if the game ceases, if I remove an element in order to fix it, there is no longer any equality that is not false—I move from the tragic to the laughable” (Bataille, 1972: 95).

In dialogue with Bataille’s philosophy, *Disco Elysium* thus proposes a form of tragic and fragmentary subjectivity that remains permanently in play. Its radical gesture lies in affirming contingency, chance, and the impossibility of reconciliation as necessary conditions for inhabiting the world. Within this horizon, the game is not configured as a means of escape, but as a practice of ontological production, in which existence is defined by openness to the unpredictable. Subjectivity is not constructed from a stable identity, but from the capacity to expose oneself to difference, risk, and transformation.

This existential horizon finds one of its clearest formulations in Bataille’s own words:

> To want to be everything—or God—is to want to suppress time, to suppress luck.
>Not to want this is to want time, to want luck.
>Wanting luck is *amor fati*.
>*Amor fati* means wanting luck, differing from what already was. Gaining the unknown and playing.
>To play, for the individual, is to risk losing or winning. For the whole, it is to overcome what is given, to go beyond.
>Playing is, in short, bringing into being what was not there before (in this sense, time is history). (Bataille, 1972: 154)

## Notes
[^1] The title won all four awards for which it was nominated: "Best Narrative," "Best Independent Game," "Best Role-Playing Game," and "New Indie Game."
[^2] We are not the first to link *Disco Elysium* with eminently philosophical issues. First, we must highlight the works that have connected the Estonian title with video game studies, addressing issues such as player agency through a complex system of options: Bodi, B., & Thon, J. (2020). Playing Stories?: Narrative-Dramatic Agency in *Disco Elysium* (2019) and Astro-neer (2019). Frontiers of Narrative Studies, 6(2), 57–190. We can also highlight those that deal with the relationship between passivity and activity when constructing subjectivity in video games: Shin, S. (2024). *Disco Elysium* and the Intersection of Interactivity and Interpassivity. Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media, 62. Likewise, Moldes’ research, which draws on Gonzalo Frasca, explores the possibility of presenting video games as a tool for agitation and propaganda, presenting *Disco Elysium* as a paradigmatic case: Moldes, V. (2022). Video Games as Agitprop: *Disco Elysium* as a Case Study, Polytechnic University of Valencia.
Secondly, we can look at works that focus even more closely on specific political or philosophical issues. Regarding the spatiality and physical elements of the *Disco Elysium* universe, such as interaction with objects in the virtual world: Kłosiński, M. (2021). The Object Gives Rise to Thought: Hermeneutics of Objects in *Disco Elysium*. Baltic Screen Media Review, 9, 57–66. On the dark and Gothic atmosphere of the urban space: Novitz, J. (2021). *Disco Elysium* as Gothic Fiction. Baltic Screen Media Review, 9, 33–41; Nichols, F. (2024). Welcome to Revachol: *Disco Elysium* as Virtual Dark Tourism. In N. Sharma, A. Martini, D. Timothy (Eds.), Critical Theories in Dark Tourism. De Gruyter; Medvedeva, A. (2022). Urban Shivers: Recording Actual Space in *Disco Elysium*. Galactica Media, 4(3), 157–175. On the political significance of different spaces through which the main character travels: Defernez, V. (2023). Espaces et discours politiques: "La Martinaise" et ses habitants, quartier de *Disco Elysium*. University of Lorraine.
Some research has drawn direct connections to key thinkers or philosophical concepts, further highlighting the philosophical discourse of *Disco Elysium*: Khamis, D. (2024). *Disco Elysium* as Philosophy: Solipsism, Existentialism, and Simulacra. In Kowalski, D. (Ed.), The Palgrave Handbook of Popular Culture as Philosophy. Palgrave Macmillan. Belmonte, J. (2021). The Hanged Rhizome on the Tree: Arborescence and Multiplicity in *Disco Elysium*. Baltic Screen Media Review, 9, 44–54. Meier, M. (2024). “Sunrise, Parabellum”: The Crisis of the State and the Individual in *Disco Elysium*. In Mochocki, M. et al. (Eds.), Central and Eastern European Histories and Heritages in Video Games. Routledge. In these works by Khamis, Belmonte, and Meier, 18th-century German idealism, French existentialism, and poststructuralist notions of rhizome or subject are directly related to video game characters, mechanics, and sometimes specific dialogues of some of the skills that guide our progress. Issues such as hauntology, reflecting the radical amnesia of our protagonist and the revolutionary past of the city of Revachol: Maqbool, S. (2024). Disco-Oriented Hauntology. In J. Anderson & C. White (Eds.), Reading *Disco Elysium*, special issue, Post45, 1. As well as the attempt to map the different political ideologies that populate the texts of *Disco Elysium* and their relationships to each other: Defernez, V. (2022). Faire l’exercice des possibles idéologiques: l’exemple de *Disco Elysium*, CRPG estonien. Université de Lorraine, have also received considerable attention from academia.
[^3] As Saad Maqbool points out in relation to the probabilities of success in *Disco Elysium*'s dice rolls: "Even so, no matter their skill level, there is only ever a maximum of 97% chance of success: double one on the virtual dice roll is always a miss; double six is always a pass. With the ever-present chance of failure (and the unpredictability of what 'success' might even look like), levelling a skill does not guarantee mastery over any of the game's systems" (2024: 6).

(2021), The Hanged Rhizome on the Tree: Arborescence and Multiplicity in *Disco Elysium*, Baltic Screen Media Review, 9, 44-54.
